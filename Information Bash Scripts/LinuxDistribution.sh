# This scripting file will be used to allow me to learn and review information for various Linux Distributions, from Ubuntu and Arch to Fedora and PopOs.

# Choosing a Linux Distribution

# Concepts To Learn: Rolling Release Method (Debian and Arch), Package Management Systems

# Words To Learn: Incremental, Proprietary, Enterprise, Derivatives

# Main Three Package Managers: 
# DPKG - Debian Package Management System

    # APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)
    # APM (Aptitutde Packagae Manager)
    # Synaptic Package Manager

# RPM - Red Hat Package Manager
    
    # YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)
    # DNF (Dandified YUM)

# Pacman Package Manager - Arch Linux

# Definitions:
    # Hardware - Includes all of the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc. 
    # Linux Kernel - The core of the opearting system. This manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system. 
    # For a better understanding, check out a graphic that demonstrates the connection between the operating system and the kernel. 
    # User Space - This is where users like me directly interact with the system. 

# Linux Distributions
    # Debian - Distro composed entirely of free and open-source software. Consists of 3 branches, "Stable", "Testing", and "Unstable". Debian Package Manager
    # Red Hat Enterprise Linux - Has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution, though it still provides source code for free. Uses RPM Package Manager.
    # Ubuntu - Most popular linux distro. Releases its own DE manager "Unity" by default. Great for beginners. Offers ease of use and great UI experience. Debian PM.
    # Fedora - Backed by Red Hat. Community driven containing open-source and free software. RHEL branches off of Fedora. Ubuntu equivalent backed by RHEL with RPM PM.
    # Linux Mint - Based off of Ubuntu. Uses Ubuntu's Software Repositories, so the same packages are on both distributions. Debian PM. Beginner Friendly. 
    # Gentoo - Ridiculous flexibility but at a literall price. Similiarly to Arch Linux, for advanced users. Uses it's own PM known as Portage. Portage is easy to maintain. 
    # Arch Linux - Lightweight and flexible. Driven 100% by the community. Uses the Rolling Release Method. Uses it's own PM, Pacman. Great choice for hardcore Linux users, not beginners. 
    # OpenSUSE - Created by the openSUSE Project. Second oldest still running Linux Distro. Purpose is to promote the use of Linux everywhere with free open source software. Uses RPM Package Manager.
