## Networking Basics ##

# ISP - Internet Service Provider
- This is the company you pay to get internet at your house. 

# Router - The router allows for every host on your network to conenct to the internet.
- Most modern routers allow you to connect via wireless or an Ethernet cable. 

# WAN - Wide Area Network 
- This is known as the network that encompasses everything between your router and a wider network such as the internet

# WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network
- This is the network between your router and any wireless devices you may have such as laptops. 

# LAN - Local Area Network
- This is the network between your router and any wired devices you might have like Desktop PC's.

# Hosts - Each machine on a network is known as a host. 
- An example would be a laptop on a WLAN network. 

# Packets - The data that is transmitted through networks. They travel to and from hosts. 
- An example would be the packets that travel between two Nintendo consoles when playing Smash Ultimate.

## OSI Model + TCP/IP Model ##

# OSI Layer Model - Open Systems Interconnection Model
- This is a theoretical model of networking. This is a VERY important concept to have a solid understanding of. 
- This model shows us how a packet travels through a network in seven different layers!

# TCP/IP Model 
- This model is what the internet is based off of. It is the literal implementation of networking. 
- It uses two protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP Addresses. 
- These protocols work together to specify how data is gathered, addressed, transmitted, and routed through a network.

## OSI Layers ##

# Application Layer
- This layer determines how your computer's programs interface with the transport layer services to view the data that gets sent or received.
- This layer uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    - HTTP is used for webpages on the internet. 
    - SMTP is used for electronic mail (email) transmission.

# Transport Layer 
- This layer determines how data will be transmitted, includes checking the correct ports, integrity of the data, and basically delivering our packets.
- The two main methods of sending and receiving data are using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
- They work together with IP (Internet Protocol) to direct packets from one machine to another. 
    - TCP is commonly known as reliable data delivery.
    - UDP is commonly known as unreliable data delivery.      

# Network Layer
- This layer specifies how to move packets between hosts and across networks. 
- This layer uses IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
    - Internet Protocol is a protocol that helps route packets from one machine to another. 
    - Internet Control Message Protocol helps tell us what is going on, such as error messages and debugging information. 

# Link Layer 
- This layer goes into how to send data across a physical piece of hardware, like data travelling through Ethernet, fiber, etc.
